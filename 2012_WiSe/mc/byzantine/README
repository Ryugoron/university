EXERCISE 18
-------------
a) See byzantine.pml and byzantine.h for the implementation of the procotol

b) And the bottom of byzantine.pml the ltl formulas are given

c) Spin output see files OUTPUT_LTL1 and OUTPUT_LTL2 for the two claims (retrospectively)

d) The counter example is given in the file COUNTEREXAMPLE with respect to the trail given by byzantine.pml.trail.
This trail might not be minimal, but by curiosity the error is not found anymore if we compile the pan verifier with the option -DBFS (breadth first search). So, at least, this is a counter example.
