\section*{Exercise 3}

True or False? For every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists an NP - complete problem that can be solved deterministically in
$O(2^{n^\varepsilon})$ steps. Explain your answer.

\textbf{Solution:}\\

We proof this part by construction a language for each $\varepsilon > 0$, that is $NP - complete$ and can be solved in
the given time.\\

Let PAD-SAT$_\varepsilon = \{ (\Psi , 1^{|\Psi|^{\left\lceil \frac{2}{\varepsilon} \right\rceil}}) \; | \; \Psi \text{ satisfiable in 3 cnf} \}$\\

\begin{lemma}\label{ex1:t3:npc}
	$\text{PAD-SAT}_\varepsilon$ is NP-complete.
\end{lemma}

\textbf{Proof \ref{ex1:t3:npc}.}\\
PAD-SAT$_\varepsilon \in$ NP.\\
Given an variable assignment we can check whether the formula $\Psi$ is satisfied in polynomial time. 
The number of variables has to be strictly smaller than the length of the formula. The assignment is polynomial bounded
in the input size hence the witness is polynomial in the size of the input.\\

3-SAT $\succ_p$ PAD-SAT$_\varepsilon$.\\
The reduction function copies the formula $\Psi$, computes $|\Psi|^{\left\lceil \frac{2}{\varepsilon} \right\rceil}$
and appends that many ones to $\Psi$. The computation can be done in polynomial time.
The reduction is valid because if $\Psi$ is satisfiable it remains satisfiable after the reduction and vis-versa.

\begin{lemma}\label{ex1:t3:time}
    There exists a DTM M such that $T_M(n) \in DTIME (2^{n^\varepsilon})$.
\end{lemma}

\textbf{Proof \ref{ex1:t3:time}.}\\
We construct a DTM M that checks the satisfiability by brute-force.
Given a word $w = (\Psi, 1^{|\Psi|^{\left\lceil \frac{2}{k} \right\rceil}})$ with $n = |w|$.\\
It holds that $|\Psi| \leq n^\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$. Otherwise 
$|w| = |\Psi| + |\Psi|^{\left\lceil \frac{2}{k} \right\rceil} > n^\frac{\varepsilon}{2} + (n^\frac{\varepsilon}{2})^{\frac{2}{k}} > n$
holds which is a contradiction.\\

$\Rightarrow$ There exists at most $n^\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ possible assignments for $\Psi$. We can
compute the result for a given assignment in $n^c$ time for some $c > 0$.

Therefore $T_M (n) \leq n^c \cdot 2^{n^\frac{\varepsilon}{2}}$. At last we prove that $T_M(n) \in O(2^{n^\varepsilon})$.

$$
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{T_M (n)}{2^{n^\varepsilon}} = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} n^c \cdot 2^{n^\frac{\varepsilon}{2} - n^\varepsilon}
= n^c \cdot 2^{-n^\frac{\varepsilon}{2}} = 0
$$
By convergence criterion we know that there exist the DTM M that computes a NP complete problem in $O(2^{n^\varepsilon})$ time.\\
