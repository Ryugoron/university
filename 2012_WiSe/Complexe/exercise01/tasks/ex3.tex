\section*{Exercise 3}

True or False? For every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists an NP - complete problem that can be solved deterministicly in
$O(2^{\varepsilon n})$ steps. Explain your answer.

\textbf{Solution:}\\
If $P=NP$ holds, then the assumption holds trivialy, because  $poly(n) \in O(2^{t \cdot n})$ for arbitrary but fixed $t > 0$ holds.\\

If $P \not= NP$ holds, there exist at least for $\varepsilon \geq 1$ a algorithm that solves a NP - complete problem in $O(2^n)$, at least
we believe so.\\

For $0 < \varepsilon < 1$ we have no clue, whether this assumption holds.
