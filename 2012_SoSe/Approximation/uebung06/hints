(From general Steiner Tree Problem)

reverse deletion (cleaning up the solution)
   (After the loop finished, we might want to
   clean up the solution)
   [Ex. Dijkstra delivers a shortest-path-tree, but we only need
   a path] (May not be needed) But helps in the analysis.

   Need in : 7.5 general Branching Tree
